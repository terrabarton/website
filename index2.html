  <h1>Cultural Duties At A Stand Still Due To Covid-19<h1>
    <p>In the Nisga'a Nation, our communities have taken extreme measures during this pandemic and put a hold on all cultural events even if it is a death of a member of the Nisga'a Nation. Our Cultural duties all include large crowds in small places and we usually gather with the family to feast after the funeral to pay the expenses with everyones contribution. We had a couple of members pass away and the family let everyone know that everything will be at a later date but only a few immediate family members were able to attend the funeral.</p>

    <p>It's nice to see everyone stepping up and doing their part to stop the spreading of the virus in the Nass Valley. Nisga'a Lsims Government put signs up in the Valley to let visitors know that our tourists attractions and communties are closed for visitors. Check out the Government Current events link that brings you to Nisga'a Lisims Governments website. That will help keep you updated. Also check out the Community Currents events in the Menu to read about what the communities are doing to help out during the pandemic.</p>
